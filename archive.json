Based on the changed title, I'm assuming that we aren't worrying about SRT and RUSH in this draft - that's probably a good call, because I don't think their requirements are going to look much like RTP over QUIC requirements. There will be some places that I will need to tighten up what I wrote, because they were still in scope when I was typing. I'll merge this, and see where I end up in an hour or two of typing. ",
